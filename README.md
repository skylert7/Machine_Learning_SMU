# Machine_Learning_SMU
- This repo is the work of Skyler Tran, Clay Harper, and Taylor Slaton for Machine Learning course (Spring 2020)
- Each notebook file is one assignment which includes online sources, specific datasets and our work to go through and analyze them: 
  1. Exploring Table Data: Genetic Variant Classifications (Predict whether a variant will have conflicting clinical classifications) -

  2. Images processing: The Car Connection Picture Dataset (Business Understanding is inside this notebook) -         https://www.kaggle.com/prondeau/the-car-connection-picture-dataset
  3. Extending Logistic Regression: Genetic Variant Classifications (In this notebook, we extended our work from notebook 1 above and used Linear Regression to predict missing data) - https://www.kaggle.com/kevinarvai/clinvar-conflicting
